# Dev Description
 In this project, I have built a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, 
 that integrates a chosen public API from the given list: Public API Lists. 
 The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.
