# Dev Description
 In this project, I have built a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, 
 that integrates a chosen public API from the given list: Public API Lists. 
 The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

# Objectives
1.  Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
2. Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
3. Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
4. Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.
